# openscad-pacman
Silly pacman thing I made using OpenSCAD's animate feature. Totally pointless. It was a fun recreational programming exercise.

##Usage
To render this thing yourself, get a copy of [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html) and open up [pacman.scad](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisrobison/openscad-pacman/master/pacman.scad) in it.
